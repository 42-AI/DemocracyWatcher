# Initialize your repository:

Now all these steps are specifics to this project, and this project only !

You should first `git clone` this project, and then `cd` to it's top directory for running all the following commands.

## Create a virtualenv

```sh
python3.8 -m venv venv
```

## Initialize direnv

```sh
echo "source venv/bin/activate" > .envrc
direnv allow .
```

Now everytime you use `python` in this project it will call the binary in `venv/bin/python3.8`.

## Launch the script to initialize your project 

If it's not with execute rights, you should add them
```sh
chmod +x .42AI/init.sh
```

Then you can run the script
```sh
.42AI/init.sh
```

## Launch the project:

with this command

```sh
python -m src
```

and this one:

```sh
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
