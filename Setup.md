## Poetry

Install poetry, wich will help us manage python depedencies. 

This command should work:

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

For the installation you can follow detailed steps here: <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>

If you want to learn more about poetry, here is a great place: <https://realpython.com/dependency-management-python-poetry/>


## direnv

With direnv you will not have to think about your virtualenv anymore. It will also be easy to manage secrets as environment variables.

See this link: <https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html>

It should be something like `curl -sfL https://direnv.net/install.sh | bash` depending on your OS.

For more explanation on this tool you should read this page: <https://direnv.net/>.

## AWS CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface will be necessary to push your data to the remote s3 storage.

Here are the steps you should follow for this: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html>


# Initialize your repository

Now all these steps are specifics to this project, and this project only !

You should first `git clone` this project, and then `cd` to it's top directory for running all the following commands.


## Initialize direnv

```sh
echo "export MY_VARIABLE=\"MY_SECRET\"" > .envrc
direnv allow .
```

<!-- Now everytime you use `python` in this project it will call the binary in `venv/bin/python3.8`. -->

## Launch the script to initialize your project

If it's not with execute rights, you should add them

```sh
chmod +x .42AI/init.sh
```

Then you can run the script

```sh
.42AI/init.sh
```

For Hydra, wich is installed from requirements.txt, java is required,think to install it if you are on a fresh ubuntu.

## Verify you can launch the project

with this command

```sh
poetry run python -m src
```

and this one:

```sh
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
