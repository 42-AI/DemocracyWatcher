# Motivation
Artificial Intelligence is a broad field where a lot of methods and technics have been developped on a different forms of data.
The branch of artificial intelligence tackling with natural language data is *NLP* (Natural Language Processing).

There are several tasks in this branch: Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Speech Recognition, Spech Segmentation, Text-to-speech Word-segmentation (Tokenization), Sentiment Analysis, and so on.

The project **Sentimental Big Brother (SBB)** is the opportunity to dive into the *NLP* sub-field by tackling on a specific task named *Sentiment Analysis*.

# Description
In this project, we are working on textual data: the tweets, retrieve thanks to the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs).
The first step consisted into create a pipeline to collect tweets requested to Twitter API and store this data into a dataset (see the documentation of the [data pipeline documentation](https://github.com/42-AI/SentimentalBB/issues/66)).
Once we made a dataset, we created a pipeline to train the desired model.

We experimented ... models which can be classified into:
* Transformer based models
* Statistical based models 
* knowledge based models

The rest of the document is structure as followed: [Materials and Methods](#materials-and-methods) section where we described the dataset used and detailled theoritical concepts related to the different models and the methodology , the section [Experimental Results](#experimental-results) where the results of the experiments realized with the different models are detailled.

We finished with a [conclusion](#conclusion) about the results and the approaches.
